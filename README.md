### Compile from source

There are multiple ways to import the project into Android Studio, but this seems to be the easiest.

- At the main welcome wizard, click `Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, ect.)` and navigate to the folder you cloned the repo to.
- To compile, go to `Build -> Make Project (Ctrl + F9)`
- To install and run on a connected Android phone, go to `Run -> Run 'app' (Shift + F10)`


## TODO
- Update UI to include buttons that allow the user to toggle features on/off
- Configure Travis-CI builds
- Disable incoming pings

- Allow the user to selectively block calls/pings for each conversation
- Instead of blocking pings/calls altogether, generate a pop-up asking for confirmation before sending the ping/call.
- Create an app icon
